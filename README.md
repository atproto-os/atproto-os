    Open Web Desktop + AT Protocol
</h3>

## Overview
Open Web Desktop (OWD) is a framework designed to provide a simple environment for building web-based desktop experiences. It's built with Vue.js & TypeScript, and it leverages the extensible Nuxt.js architecture.

[atproto OS](https://github.com/atproto-os) is providing a set of modules to kickstart your Open Web Desktop on the AT Protocol.

## Features
- Open-source web desktop bundled with AT Protocol modules
- Seamlessly login via Bluesky and keep your app states synced
- Fully extendable through themes, applications, and modules
- Store data of any application simply by extending its Pinia store
- Style your apps with PrimeVue and Tailwind for a consistent UI
- Showcase your AT Protocol project in a web-based desktop

## Starter Template

This starter template is decked with some basic applications and dedicated AT Protocol modules.

#### Generic Applications
- [@owdproject/app-about](https://github.com/owdproject/app-about)
- [@owdproject/app-debug](https://github.com/owdproject/app-debug)
- [@owdproject/app-terminal](https://github.com/owdproject/app-terminal)
- [@owdproject/app-todo](https://github.com/owdproject/app-todo)
- [@owdproject/app-wasmboy](https://github.com/owdproject/app-wasmboy)

#### AT Protocol Modules
- [@owdproject/app-atproto](https://github.com/atproto-os/app-atproto)
- [@owdproject/module-atproto](https://github.com/atproto-os/module-atproto)
- [@owdproject/module-pinia-atproto](https://github.com/atproto-os/module-pinia-atproto)

## Getting started

Fork the project and clone it with something like:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/atproto-os.git
```

Once ready, you can start the development server:
```bash
# Run the dev server + hot-reload with npm
npm install
npm run dev

# Or use pnpm for a faster experience
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Configuring atprotoOS
atprotoOS works out-of-the-box, but if you are going to deploy it somewhere, you will need to accordingly update your `atproto` configuration in `nuxt.config.ts` for the AT Protocol auth to work correctly.

```js
atproto: {
    serviceEndpoint: {
        private: 'https://bsky.social',
        public: 'https://public.api.bsky.app'
    },
    oauth: {
        clientMetadata: {
            // url of your remote client_metadata.json, leave the field empty
            // to let `nuxt-atproto` generate a local /public/client_metadata.json
            remote: '',
            // configuration for the local client_metadata.json
            local: {
                client_id: "http://127.0.0.1/client-metadata.json",
                client_name: "nuxt-atproto",
                client_uri: "http://127.0.0.1",
                logo_uri: "http://127.0.0.1/logo.png",
                tos_uri: "http://127.0.0.1",
                policy_uri: "http://127.0.0.1",
                redirect_uris: ["http://127.0.0.1"],
                scope: "atproto", // use "atproto transition:generic" in production
                grant_types: ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
                response_types: ["code"],
                token_endpoint_auth_method: "none",
                application_type: "web",
                dpop_bound_access_tokens: true
            }
        },
        signInOptions: {
            state: "",
            prompt: "login",
            scope: "atproto", // use "atproto transition:generic" in production
            ui_locales: "en",
        },
    },
    debug: true,
}
```

## Extend your desktop

Thanks to Tailwind and PrimeVue, you can create custom themes from scratch and ensure a consistent look across all apps. Each theme defines its own style, making your desktop both cohesive and uniquely yours.

[Applications](https://github.com/topics/owd-apps) ¬∑ [Modules](https://github.com/topics/owd-modules) ¬∑ [Themes](https://github.com/topics/owd-themes)

### üß© Install an application

You can discover new apps by searching for the [owd-apps](https://github.com/topics/owd-apps) tag on GitHub.

For example, to install the To-do app:

```bash
nx run desktop:install-app --name=@owdproject/app-todo
```

This will install the package and automatically register it in your desktop configuration.

### üß© Install a module

You can discover new modules by searching for the [owd-modules](https://github.com/topics/owd-modules) tag on GitHub.

For example, to install the session persistence module:

```bash
nx run desktop:install-module --name=@owdproject/module-pinia-localforage
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Themes

Themes are full desktop environments that style all UI components independently using [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/).  
Each theme provides a unique look and feel while maintaining consistent functionality across all applications.

You can discover new themes by searching for the [owd-themes](https://github.com/topics/owd-themes) tag on GitHub.

```bash
nx run desktop:install-theme --name=@owdproject/theme-gnome
```
